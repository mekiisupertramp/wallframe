# Wall Frame

This project focuses on creating a customizable wall-mounted frame to display collectibles like action figures or memorabilia. Integrated RGB LEDs (e.g., WS2812B) will illuminate the items, allowing for dynamic color patterns and adjustable brightness to enhance their presentation. The frame serves as both a functional display and a stylish decorative piece.

This [guide](https://mekiisupertramp.github.io/essays/wf_rgb.html) will walk you through setting up Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to program the Raspberry Pi Pico W using the MicroPico module. The Pico W, equipped with built-in Wi-Fi, will act as the control unit for the LEDs and additional features, enabling easy customization and potential wireless control.
